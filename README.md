# Port-Scanner
Port Scanners are primarily used for Penetration Testing and Information Gathering. Essentially, we are looking for open ports in a host for one of two reasons. To ensure our servers are secure or to exploit those of someone else. An unnecessarily opened port means vulnerability and comes with a lack of security.

## Language and Modules Used
The language used to make this port scanner is Python 3.7 and the modules used are as follows:
1. socket
2. sys
3. time

## About The Program
